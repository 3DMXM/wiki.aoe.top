# Importing Animations into Blender
Quick guide on importing animations onto existing and compatible skeletal meshes in Blender.


First, you have to import the skeletal mesh into Blender, which we've covered in [Importing Models into Blender](/Misc/BlenderImportModels.md) guide.

1. Select the root object, the armature itself.
2. File -> Import -> PSA Animations _(part of the PSK plugin)_.
3. Provide a compatible animation file `.psa`.

If done correctly, the imported animation will be ready to play and edit.

> [!NOTE]  
> In Blender 4, you have to go to Dope Sheet, Action Editor and select the available/imported action(s).
