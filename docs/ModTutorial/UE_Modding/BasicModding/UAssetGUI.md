# Using UAssetGUI
UAssetGUI is a user-interfaced tool for essentially hex editing but without seeing any hex.

You can download the latest release of UAssetGUI [here](https://github.com/atenfyr/UAssetGUI/releases).

## Example - Changing clip size for Trepang2
For this example, we will change the magazine size for the SMG weapon, which is located inside the weapon's blueprint called `BP_SMG`.

<br>
I'm using FModel as it's easier and faster to navigate.<br>
Once the file is found, export the asset, resulting in 2 files, `.uasset` and `.uexp`.

<br>

### Open using UAssetGUI.
Default variables are always located in the Export starting with 
`(Default__...)`

As we can see, there are quite a handful of values we can change.<br>
But in this example, we will change the maximum clip size.

Once the changes are made, simply save the file! <br>
The tool will automatically generate `.bak` file, but you don't need them, so feel free to remove them.

### 
The last step is to pack the modified `.uasset` and `.uexp` using UnrealPak, and you're done!

## Editing via JSON (alternative option)
UAssetGUI allows to export uasset files into editable `.json` files.<br>
File -> Save As, and pick the `.json` as the save-type.

JSON format gives full control over the structure of the asset.

Once the changes are made and saved:
Load the modified json file into UAssetGUI, and then save it as a regular `.uasset` file.

## Example 2 - Trepang2: adding items to list (advanced)
We know that we can edit, replace, and remove elements from an asset but how about adding new elements?<br>
In this example, we will add an element to an array that doesn't exist in the asset. <br>

![](/Media/uassetgui/fmodel_trepang_mission1.png)
In Trepang2, there's a game mode HordeMode which stores all of its available levels in a list/array, inside `BP_CombatSimMissionList_Trepang2`.

Export to Uasset, open using UAssetGUI and save to `.json`. <br>


**Note:** save json via UAssetGUI, **not** FModel.<br> FModel creates a read-only json...


To achieve adding a completely new element, you need 4 things: <br>
1. Add new NameMap (references).<br>
2. Add Imports (reference declaration).<br>
3. Adjust NameCount in Generation.<br>
4. Add item to the array.<br>



For this example, I want to add `Mission_Horde_Killstation` to the list, which is an unused level but still functioning.

### Adding new NameMap
The NameMap contains all the used references.

![](/Media/uassetgui/json_trepang_mission1.png)<br>
Each reference exists in 3 formats, which we need to add for our new level.<br>
Scroll down to the bottom and add these 3 lines:<br>
```json
    "/Game/UI/CombatSimulator/Missions/UNUSED/Mission_Horde_Killstation",
    "Default__Mission_Horde_Killstation_C",
    "Mission_Horde_Killstation_C"
```

![](/Media/uassetgui/json_trepang_mission2.png)<br>
_(don't forget to add `,` on the last item before adding, as I have after the "Package")_


### Add Imports
Scroll down a bit and find the `Imports` section.

![](/Media/uassetgui/json_trepang_mission3.png)

Scroll to the bottom of Imports, and add these 3 sections;
The Package declaration, Blueprint declaration, and Class Declaration.

![](/Media/uassetgui/json_trepang_mission4.png)

The object names refer to the 3 NameMap added earlier.<br>
The `OuterIndex` points to the initial Import out of the 3. <br>
The last Import is `-122` making our import in index `-123`, thus we specify that index for the Blueprint and Class declaration.
<br>

### Adjust NameCount in Generation
Scroll down until you find the `Generations` section, containing the number of `NameCount`.
<br>![](/Media/json_trepang_mission5.png)<br>
Append the count by the number of additional added imports.<br>
Which is `3` for this example, making the NameCount: `135`.


### Add item to the array
For this example, I want to append the array `CombatSimulatorMissions` which can be found by searching within the `.json` file. <br>

![](/Media/uassetgui/json_trepang_mission6.png)

Duplicate the first element, and adjust the value to point to the BlueprintGeneratedClass that was added earlier.

Why `-124`?<br>
The last index was `-122`, the first import (the path/package) was `-123` and the BlueprintGeneratedClass was one after, making it `-124`.

### Save changes!
Save the modified `.json` file, and open it using UAssetGUI.<br>
If done correctly, no errors will appear and you can double-check that everything is added correctly by viewing the NameMap, ImportData, and the actual array, ensuring it has the items and points to the correct element.

Make sure you save, so UAssetGUI can generate the updated `.uasset` and `.uexp` files.

Once done, simply pack using UnrealPak.
