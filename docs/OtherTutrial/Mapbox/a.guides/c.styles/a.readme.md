# Map Styles

Map styles define the look and feel of a map, including its colors, background, roads, labels, points of interest, and other visual elements. Mapbox GL JS enables developers to apply predefined styles or load custom styles to fit their application's design needs. Once a style is loaded, developers can programmatically change the style's appearance at runtime, adding and removing layers, changing layer properties, and more.

These guides explain core concepts of loading and configuring styles, and understanding how layers work with Mapbox GL JS.
