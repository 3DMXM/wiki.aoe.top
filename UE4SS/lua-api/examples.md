# Examples

* Check the code snippets at the bottom of the individual pages in the Lua API section and [tutorials](../guides/creating-a-lua-mod.md) in this repository.
* Hogwarts Legacy modding uses UE4SS' Lua API for its primary logic mods. This [website](https://modding.wiki/en/hogwartslegacy/developers/luaexamples) contains example code for some of the mods.
    * You can search for interesting code in that page, the collapsed sections of the webpage will auto-expand when the text is found.
* The [Palworld modding wiki](https://pwmodding.wiki/docs/category/lua-modding) has some decent docs and examples on how to develop Lua mods for new learners.
* Search GitHub for any Lua code calling reasonably uniquely-named UE4SS API functions, excluding the actual UE4SS repository from the search:
    * https://github.com/search?q=language%3ALua+StaticFindObject+NOT+repo%3AUE4SS-RE%2FRE-UE4SS&type=code
    * https://github.com/search?q=language%3ALua+FindFirstOf+NOT+repo%3AUE4SS-RE%2FRE-UE4SS&type=code
    * and so on, as long as `language:Lua` is specified in the query
